                Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society. In
                this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation.
                Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle
                classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is designed to guide them in learning a
                culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role
                in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of what one
                would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers.
